# Abhinay Nalam(011683075) Pantry Node Portfolio
## Summary:
The progress of a project across several sprints.Discussions were held with the Front-End and Back-End Teams to determine the technology stack. The UI planning on Figma was assigned, and the architecture and file structure were finalized. Focus shifted to learning React with TypeScript, while addressing issues through discussions with the frontend team. Later I started learning testing with JEST and further discussions on implementing test cases and resolving issues.

Issue related to the Forget Password and Verification Page was resolved, as documented in a pull request. Finally,  additional test cases were added to SaleTable, as detailed in another pull request. Overall, the timeline demonstrates a progression of activities, including technology stack decisions, UI planning, learning new technologies, resolving issues, and adding test cases, all with collaboration and discussions with the relevant teams.
